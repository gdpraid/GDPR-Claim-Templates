Right of Access Request under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

According to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), European citizens have a right to demand a copy of their information and receive details on how the information is used under Article 13, 14 and 15.

I am concerned that your organizationâ€™s information practices may be putting my personal data at risk of being exposed or that you may already have breached your obligation to keep my personal information safe.

I anticipate a reply to my request within one month as required by Article 12, failing which I will be sending this inquiry with a letter of complaint to the Data Protection Authority.

I request access to all personal data you hold that relates to me pursuant to Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

In addition, I would like you to address the following, especially as it relates to my data:

- the purposes of your processing;

- the categories of personal data concerned;

- the recipients or categories of recipient you disclose the personal data to;

- your retention period for storing the personal data or, where this is not possible, your criteria for determining how long you will store it;

- the existence of the right to request rectification, erasure or restriction or to object to such processing;

- information about the source of the data, where it was not obtained directly from the individual;

- the existence of automated decision-making (including profiling); and

- the safeguards you provide if you transfer personal data to a third country or international organisation.

If you do not wish to or cannot provide access to all of my data, I ask you to state the reasons with precise reference to law and relevant articles in the data protection regulation, so that I have the necessary background information should I choose to lodge a complaint with the Data Proteciton Authorities.

I ask that you send me the information in a secure manner so that this request does not lead to further consequences in regards to my personal information.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
