**Right of Access Request under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**

Dear [Name of the company or organization],

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants European citizens a right to demand a copy of their information and receive details on how their data is used.

I request access to all personal data you hold that relates to me pursuant to Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

In addition, I would like you to address the following, especially as it relates to my data:

- the purposes of your processing;

- the categories of personal data concerned;

- the recipients you have disclosed my personal data to, and what data has been disclosed to them;

- your retention period for storing the personal data or, where this is not possible, your criteria for determining how long you will store it;

- how I can request rectification, erasure or restriction or object to your data processing;

- information about the source of the data, where it was not obtained directly from me;

- the existence of automated decision-making (including profiling); and

- the safeguards you provide if you transfer personal data to a third country or an international organization.

If your organization has a privacy statement, I would like you to make sure that it adresses all of the above concerns. In the event that you have supplied data to third parties, however, I want a list of what third parties have in fact received my information.

If your organization has a self-service option letting your users can download their data in a commonly used machine-readable format from your website, please advise where I can access this option and whether it contains all of the data you hold or not. If your self-download option does not provide access to all of my data, please explain what data is not included, and provide access to the omitted information.

Please be aware that I also want access to information you may hold on any closed accounts I have had with you in the past, that might not be available through self-service. I am attaching a copy of my passport and a list of current and previous email addresses, which may help you better identify my information.

If you do not wish to or cannot provide access to my information, I ask you to state the reasons with precise reference to law and relevant articles in the data protection regulation, so that I have the necessary background information should I choose to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Authority (DPA).

I ask that you send me the information in a secure manner so that this request does not lead to further consequences in regards to my personal information.

In accordance with Article 12, I expect a response to my request without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt.

I look forward to receiving your reply.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
