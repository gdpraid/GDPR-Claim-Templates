# GDPR-Claim-Templates
Use these templates to exercise your GDPR rights as a European citizen. Feel free to adapt as you like.

# Suggetions on use
It is adviseable in most cases to first ask for access to your data, then send an erasure request separately after having looked at what you got, if you believe the company or organization is storing excessive amounts of personal data on you. You may send these templates in a letter by ordinary mail or by email. I would recommend sending the request by ordinary mail and including a copy of your passport as well as any information you have that may help them identify your data, such as current or previous email addresses and phone numbers. 

However, it may also be appropriate to use the combined claims if you are confident that the organization you are filing the request with will treat it in a thorough and reliable manner.

# The templates, explained

# Company mailing addresses for submitting claims

I've gathered [the mailing addresses](https://github.com/gdpraid/GDPR-Claim-Templates/blob/master/Relevant-addresses.md) of some of the largest companies that collect your data. Please contribute with other relevant addresses if you know which ones are appropriate to use. 

# Data downloads and closed accounts

It is usually better to send a manual claim either in addition to or instead of requesting a download, as automated data gathering does not necessarily provide all personal information a company may be storing. Also, the option is usually not available if you do not currently hold an account. Even though some companies claim the opposite, one does have the right to access and erasure even the account has been closed. Companies need to make an effort to identify that you are the right person if they hold data on you. For instance, if you still have access to the email you used, any phone numbers they still have or your name and birth date is unique and matches your passport, they should be able to treat your claim.
