# GDPR-Claim-Templates
Consumer templates to exercise GDPR rights.

A couple of GDPR claim templates you may use to exercise your GDPR rights as a European citizen. Feel free to use and adapt these as you like.

Suggetions on use;
It is adviseable in most cases to first ask for access to your data in a separate request, then send an erasure request regarding the data you believe it is excessive for the organization to store. You may send these templates in a letter by ordinary mail or by email. I would recommend sending by ordinary mail and including a copy of your passport as well as any information you have that may help them identify your data, such as current or previous email addresses and phone numbers.

However, it may also be appropriate to use the combined claims if you are confident that the organization you are filing the request with will treat it in a thorough and reliable manner.

**Access-my-data.md**<br/>
Use this to demand a copy of all your data.

**Erasure-request.md**<br/>
After reviewing the data, use this template to demand that the company delete parts of (or all) your data.

**Deliver-my-data-then-erase-what-you-do-not-need.md**<br/>
Combined access and erasure request, asking the company to delete all data not strictly needed to maintain your customer account and services you use or have paid for.

**Deliver-my-data-then-erase-everything.md**<br/>
Combined access and erasure request, asking the company to deliver all data, then delete it.
