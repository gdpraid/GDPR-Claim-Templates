After having reviewed the information you sent me, I request erasure of:

[Indicate the personal data you want deleted]

The above data is, as I see it, not necessary to store in relation to the purpose for which you originally collected or processed it. I withdraw my consent for you to process the above data.

If you do not wish to delete the information, I ask you to state the reasons with precise reference to law and relevant articles in the data protection regulation, so that I have the necessary background information should I choose to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Authority (DPA).

In the event that you have disclosed any of my data to third parties, please advise me, inform them of this request and make sure they also delete the data.

Please send me your reply in a secure manner so that this request does not lead to further consequences in regards to my personal information

In accordance with Article 12, I expect a response to my request without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt.

I look forward to receiving your reply.

Best regards,
