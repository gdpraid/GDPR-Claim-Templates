**Erasure Request under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**

According to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), European citizens have a right to data erasure under Article 17.

After having reviewed the information you sent me, I request erasure of:

[Indicate the personal data you want deleted]

The above data is, as I see it, not necessary to store in relation to the purpose which you originally collected or processed it for. I withdraw my consent for you to process the above data.

If you do not wish to delete said data, I ask you to state the reasons with precise reference to law and relevant articles in the data protection regulation, so that I have the necessary background information should I choose to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Authority (DPA).

I ask that you send me the information in a secure manner so that this request does not lead to further consequences in regards to my personal information. If I do not receive a reply within one month, as specified in Article 12, I will consider filing a complaint with the DPA.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
