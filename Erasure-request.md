**Erasure Request under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**

Dear [Name of the company or organization],

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants European citizens a right to data erasure (the right to be forgotten) under Article 17.

After having reviewed the information you sent me, I request erasure of:

[Indicate the personal data you want deleted]

The above data is, as I see it, not necessary to store in relation to the purpose which you originally collected or processed it for. I withdraw my consent for you to process the above data.

If you do not wish to delete the information, I ask you to state the reasons with precise reference to law and relevant articles in the data protection regulation, so that I have the necessary background information should I choose to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Authority (DPA).

I ask that you send me information in a secure manner so that this request does not lead to further consequences in regards to my personal information. If I do not receive a reply within one month, as specified in Article 12, I will consider filing a complaint with the DPA.

In the event that you have disclosed any of my data to third parties, please advise me, inform them of this request and make sure they also delete the data.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
