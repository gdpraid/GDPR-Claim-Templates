**Right of Access and Erasure Request under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**

According to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), European citizens have a right to demand a copy of their information under Article 13, 14 and 15 and a right to data erasure (the right to be forgotten) under Article 17.

I am worried that your organization may be putting my personal data at risk of exposure or that you may already have breached your obligation to keep my personal information safe.

I request access to all personal data you hold that relates to me pursuant to Article 13, 14 and 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

In addition, I would like you to address the following, especially as it relates to my data:

- the purposes of your processing;

- the categories of personal data concerned;

- the recipients you have disclosed my personal data to, and what data has been disclosed to them;

- your retention period for storing the personal data or, where this is not possible, your criteria for determining how long you will store it;

- the existence of the right to request rectification, erasure or restriction or to object to such processing;

- information about the source of the data, where it was not obtained directly from me;

- the existence of automated decision-making (including profiling); and

- the safeguards you provide if you transfer personal data to a third country or international organisation.

I believe most of the personal data you are processing is no longer necessary to store for the purpose which you originally collected or processed it for. I withdraw my consent for you to process data about me as soon as the data has been delivered to me as requested above.

On this basis, I ask that you delete all personal data about me as soon as a copy of said data has been delivered to me. I ask for a final confirmation when this has been done.

If you do not wish to delete all of the data, I ask you to state the reasons with precise reference to law and relevant articles in the data protection regulation, so that I have the necessary background information should I choose to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Authority (DPA).

I ask that you send me the information in a secure manner so that this request does not lead to further consequences in regards to my personal information. If I do not receive a reply within one month, as specified in Article 12, I will consider filing a complaint with the DPA.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
