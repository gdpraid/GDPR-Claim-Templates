I consider identifiers such as anonymised and non-anonymised advertising IDs linked to me or devices I have used, personal information about me provided by others (such as my phone number from other users' uploaded contact lists) and IP addresses I use or have used historically to constitute part of what is considered my personal information and thus subject to the right of access and erasure under Article 15 and 17.

In that regard, I ask that you please purge any such information.

In regards to this particular type of data, please indicate what such data you store and whether and how the data could have its' origin in information about me or be derived from my internet usage and behaviour.

Furthermore, I demand that you please explain how I can reserve myself from storage of this type of information about me in the future. I am especially worried about the use of my information for marketing purposes without my consent.

I am supplying a list of previous email addresses and phone numbers with my request so you may better identify the information.
