**General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) complaint**

On [Date], I asked [Company] for a full copy of my data as well as for details regarding how the data has been and is used.

[Company] replied on [Date] without warning me that their repsonse would be late or stating a reason, in contravention of Article 12, which requires companies to reply within 30 days except in special cases.

In my view, their response is not satisfactory. The information delivered to me seems incomplete. 

[State what information you would have expected to be included in their response]

After reviewing the information provided by [Company], I asked for the erasure of the following information pursuant to Article 17 of the data protection regulation in a letter of [Date]:

[List the information you asked them to delete]

On [Date], [Company] responded, refusing to delete the following information:

[List the information they refused to delete]

I believe that [Company] is wrong in refusing my request for erasure and I should, in my opinion, have been provided access to more information.

I therefore ask you, as the competent Data Protection Authority, to review the case and make a decision on whether the delivered data and information is complete or if, in your view, [Company] should have made further effort to locate and deliver my data, and whether they in fact have a valid legal reason to refuse my request for erasure.

[You may also cite the GDPR here, and specify in what manner you believe the company has acted in contravention of the regulation's provisions, if you like]

Please find a copy of my passport, all correspondence between me and [Company] as well as the information delivered to me attached.

I look forward to your reply.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
