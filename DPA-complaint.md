**General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) complaint**

On May 25 2018, I asked [Company] for a full copy of my data as well as for details regarding how the data has been and is used.

[Company] replied on June 30 2018, in contravention of Article 12, which requires companies to reply within 30 days.

In my view, the response is not satisfactory. The information delivered to me seems incomplete. 

[State what information you would have expected to be included in their response]

After reviewing the information provided by [Company], I asked for the erasure of the following information pursuant to Article 17 of the data protection regulation in a letter of July 10 2018:

[List the information you asked them to delete]

On July 20, [Company] responded, refusing to delete the following information:

[List the information they refused to delete]

I believe that [Company] is wrong in refusing my request. I therefore ask you, as the competent Data Protection Authority, to review the case and make a decision on whether the delivered data and information is complete or if, in your view, [Company] should have made further effort to locate and deliver my data, and whether they in fact have a valid legal reason to refuse my request for erasure.
